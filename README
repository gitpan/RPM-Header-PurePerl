Perl-RPM-Perlonly - Native bindings to the RPM package format, without needing rpm.

Version: 1.0.1

WHAT IS IT:

  Perl-RPM-Perlonly is a clone of RPM::Header written in only perl, so it provides
  a way to read a rpm package on systems where rpm is installed. Perl-RPM-Perlonly
  can used as a drop in replacement for RPM::Header, if needed also the other way 
  around.

  The interface is a tied-hash, there are some tags not provided by RPM::Header but
  avalible in Perl-RPM-Perlonly:
    
    DESCRIPTIONLANGS:
      An array of languages not exported by RPM::Header, this is need to know 
      what language a ie. description, summary, etc. is. "C" is the normal value
      of the default. RPM::Perlonly also provides description, summary.
  
    LEAD_*:
      Information for the package LEAD, this information is also in the RPM tags
      and is provided for internal use to validate a RPM package.
      
    PACKAGE_OFFSET:
      Offset of cpio.gz file in bytes, can be used to extract the cpio.gz archive.
  
    UNKNOWN[0-9]:
      Unknown tags for internal use not exported by the std RPM::Header interface.

BUILDING/INSTALLING:

  This package is set up to configure and build like a typical Perl extension.
  To build:
    
    perl Makefile.PL
    make && make test

  If the RPM package passes all tests, then:
  
    make install

You may need super-user access to install.
